TinyMUSH 4.0 Credits
====================

Thanks to the following people who commited patch or helped solving
issues:

- Lydia Leong, for giving lots of good inputs..

TinyMUSH 3.3 Credits
====================

Thanks to the following people who commited patch or helped solving
issues:

- Susan Tussing, who fixed some issues with structures.
- Stephen Dennis, who pointed out an old bug in mail.c dating from
  TinyMUX 1.6.
- Ashen-Shugar, who's continously pointing out new bugs and throwing
  in an idea now and then.

TinyMUSH 3.2 Credits
====================

TinyMUSH 3.2 is primary the work of Lydia Leong who wrote almost all 
(if not all) new features and enhancements. Things changes as we grow
older, priorities too, and she still finds the time to keep an eye on
the software and enhance it when she can / get new ideas.

I know, this is not the usual credits but i think Lydia deserve a
release in her name to celebrate her many years of implications in the
Mu* community.

Keep on the good work Lydia. Thanks for everything you have done.


TinyMUSH 3.0 Credits
====================

TinyMUSH 3.0 is a derivation/merger of TinyMUSH 2.2.5 and TinyMUX 1.6,
with some additional extensive code revisions, bugfixing, and feature
enhancements. 

The original TinyMUSH 3.0 development team consisted of Lydia Leong
("Amberyl") and David Passmore ("Lauren"); Robby Griffin ("Alierak")
joined at 3.0 beta 18, Scott Dorr ("Myrddin") joined at 3.0 beta 23,
and Eddy Beaupre ("Tyr") joined at 3.1 patchlevel 1.

In addition to the lots of people we've already thanked from earlier
work on the servers, we'd like to make special note of:

- Deborah Wilson-Hooker ("Ysabel"), who prodded us in the direction of
  doing a lot of neat things that we eventually didn't incorporate, in
  the interests of a faster time-to-release, but which we're nonetheless
  grateful for.

- T. Alexander Popiel, JT Traub, and Andrew Molitor, as always

- Fred "Iago" Hicks, for the logo

- The members of the Gods, Softcode, TinyMUX, Hogs, and Tinymush-Unoff
  lists, for ongoing support and patience, as well as bug reports and
  new feature requests. Adam Dray, Brazil, Soruk, and Talek deserve
  special thanks here, also.

- The various people who helped us in the initial phases of the alpha
  test, loaned us hardware to do compiles on, and otherwise donated us
  time and equipment.

- Our Godlike partner-in-crime Fred Hicks ("Iago"), and the Godlike
  customers who volunteered for the alpha test, and the players of our
  initial alpha test games (From the Ashes, Blood of Amber, and
  Babylon 5: The Last Best Hope).

- The players of From the Ashes, Babylon 5: The Last Best Hope, and Blood
  of Amber, for alpha testing

- The TinyMUX and Hogs lists, and the players of the Godlike Edge, for
  everything

- Many other people who may go unnamed. Dozens of people have contributed to
  development of the TinyMU* family of servers, and we would like to thank
  them for their hard work.

... and everyone who participated in the religious wars between TinyMUSH
    and TinyMUX, which ultimately spurred our decision to merge them. :)

TinyMUX 1.0 Credits
===================

TinyMUX 1.0 is derived from TinyMUSH 2.0.10 patchlevel 6. It is maintained
by David Passmore (Lauren@From the Ashes) and would not exist without
the generous contributions of many individuals. Ideas for features (and
occasionally code) came from many places, including TinyMUSE, and PennMUSH.

We would like to thank the following people:
 
- Dave Peterson (Evinar) who maintained TinyMUSH 2.0 in its later
  incarnations.
 
- TinyMUSH 2.2, and PennMUSH 1.50 for many functions carried over for
  compatibility, and parts of the help text. These are documented as they
  appear in the source code. This code would not be possible without these
  two servers.

- James Callahan (Darkenelf), who contributed many patches, and ideas
  (@teleport/quiet, @readcache fixes, side effect functions,
   many bug fixes)
 
- Chris (Children of the Atom) who had many, many, many ideas and found
  many, many, many bugs, in his own gleeful manner of crashing our site.
 
- Alan Schwartz (Javelin/Paul) and Lydia Leong (Amberyl), whose extended
  mailer from PennMUSH is the basis for MUX's @mail system. Also,
  Brandy (CrystalMUSH) whose +mail system inspired many of the features.
 
- Ethaniel and Kayan Telva (BTech3056) for the basic comsystem and macro code.
 
- Dreamline (Horizons) who helped update the help text.

- Stephen J. Kiernan for the (very alpha) port concentrator code.

- Kalkin(DarkZone) and Harlock(StarWarsII) who extended the comsystem and
  added tons of new commands, which is basically unchanged here.
 
- Kalkin, again, for the basis of the mail alias and guest code, and the
  idea of restarting on a fatal signal.
  
- Airam (Generations) for ideas on the stack and @program code.

- Mike (StarWars), idea for not saving GOING objects, and mail expiration
  code.

- Dean Gaudet, for his user and hostname slave process code.

- The GNU project, for their wonderful database manager, and malloc package.

- Andrew Molitor, for the radix compression library, and some wonderful
  utilities.

- Robby Griffin, whose skill in uncovering obscure bugs has saved everyone
  a lot of time and effort.

TinyMUSH 2.2 Credits
====================

TinyMUSH 2.2 is a continuation of development work done on TinyMUSH 2.0.
TinyMUSH 2.0 is derived from Larry Foard's TinyMUSH (which was itself 
derived from TinyMUD, written by Jim Aspnes). TinyMUSH 2.0, written by
JT Traub (Moonchilde@PernMUSH) and Glenn Crocker (Wizard@TinyCWRU),
was a consolidation of features found in other servers, including
TinyMUSH, PernMUSH, TinyTIM, and, later, PennMUSH.
 
TinyMUSH 2.2 is primarily the work of Jean Marie Diaz (Ambar@PernMUSH),
Deborah Wilson-Hooker (Tyleet@TwoMoons), and Lydia Leong (Amberyl@PernMUSH).
 
Many, many people have contributed to TinyMUSH; our list of "thanks" is
by no means complete. A few deserve special mention here: Andrew Molitor, 
Russ Smith, Mark Vasoll, and Dave McCracken for much in the way of code and 
advice; Alan Schwartz and T. Alexander "Talek" Popiel (PennMUSH) and 
David Passmore (TinyMUX) for ideas and code; and John Batzel (and the rest
of the PernMUSH wizcrew) for beta-testing, many ideas, and a lot of patience.

In addition to the folks thanked in the 2.0 credits, we'd like to
also thank Javelin and Talek, from the PennMUSH crew, for continuing
contributions to the MUSH community and this codebase in particular.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TinyMUSH 2.0 Credits
====================
 
TinyMUSH 2.0 is derived from Larry Foard's TinyMUSH (which was itself derived
from TinyMUD, written by Jim Aspnes).  Ideas for features (and occasionally
code) came from many places, including TinyMUSE, PernMUSH, and TinyTIM.

- Lawrence Foard: Wrote the original TinyMUSH 1.0 code from which this later derived.

- Jin (and MicroMUSH): Made many, many changes to the code that improved it immensely.

- Robert Hood (virus): Modified the interface.c code to support alots of users.

- Lachesis: Introduced the idea of property lists to TinyMUCK

- Many others: Many features borrowed from other muds.
 
We would like to thank the following people:
 
- Jim Aspnes, for the original TinyMUD (from which TinyMUSH was derived)
 
- Larry Foard, for the original implementation of TinyMUSH.
 
- Marcus Ranum for the original Untermud database layer code, and  Andrew
  Molitor for getting it to work with TinyMUSH.
 
- Andrew Molitor (again) for the VMS port.
 
- Russ(Random) and Jennifer(Moira) Smith, for ideas, comments, and coding
  help.
 
- R'nice(TinyTIM) for more good ideas than we could shake a wand of coding
  at.  (@doing, @edit enhancements, a REAL use command, lotsa minor fixes and
  tweaks)
 
- Coyote(TinyTIM, DungeonMUSH, NarniaMUSH), for finding some nasty bugs and
  NOT using them for evil purposes.
 
- Ambar, Amberyl, Sh'dow, Jellan, and Miritha (all from PernMUSH) for numerous
  bug fixes, enhancements, and ideas.
 
- Sketch(TinyTIM) for rewriting some of the more confusing help file entries.
 
- Hcobb(TinyTIM) and Furie(DungeonMUSH) for inspiring the parser rewrite and
  other security-related fixes and enhancements.
 
- The many other people who have contributed ideas, comments, or complaints
  about bugs.
