DYNAMICALLY LOADABLE MODULES</h1>
<p >TinyMUSH versions 3.1 and higher provide an interface for dynamically loadable modules. This allows server administrators to write and install "hardcode" that extends the functionality of the server, without creating undue difficulties with future upgrades.</p>
<p >If you are writing a module, or you are installing a module written by someone else, please be forewarned: Modules muck directly with the server's internals. Using a module is, for all practical purposes, exactly like directly hacking the server. Thus, the safeguards that exist with softcode do not exist with modules; if modules contain bugs, they could cause severe issues with instability and database corruption.</p>
<p >If you are writing a module, you should be fluent in reading and writing the C programming language. You should take the time to carefully study the existing server code. It's assumed you can read code to figure out things that aren't explicitly documented (which is just about everything not directly related to module interface). It's also assumed that you understand how dynamic loading works.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md75"></a>
HOW TO BUILD A MODULE</h1>
<p >Every module must have a one-word name, such as "hello", or "space3d", referred to generically as '&lt;name&gt;' in the rest of this document. This is the prefix of the shared object files that are loaded by netmush.</p>
<p >The source for your module should be placed in src/modules/&lt;name&gt;. The directory must use the same name as the shared object files your code produces. The shared objects for modules go in the game/modules directory.</p>
<p >In your module's source directory you should have at least 5 files: configure.in, configure, Makefile.inc.in, .depend, and a C source file. Your best bet to get started is to make a copy of the 'hello' module source, substitute your own code for hello.c, and modify Makefile.inc.in appropriately. More advanced module code might make use of a customized configure script and Makefile, but that is beyond the scope of this document.</p>
<p >NOTE: You must change the AC_INIT macro at the top of your module's configure.in to reference one of your C source files (it doesn't matter which one as long as it exists) and then regenerate the configure script using the GNU autoconf utility. Please see:</p>
<p ><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html</a></p>
<p >Getting the server to load a module is simple. For each module, add the following line to your netmush.conf file: module &lt;name&gt;</p>
<p >Modules can only be loaded when the game is started.</p>
<p >CAUTION: If you are changing a dynamically-loaded module while the game is running, do NOT overwrite the old shared objects. The Makefile fragments we've included will move old .so files out of the way, but because they keep only one backup copy, they won't help if you rebuild your module twice before reloading it into the game. To be certain, you must go to game/modules/ and rename the .so file associated with your module.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md76"></a>
MODULE NAMES AND SYMBOLS</h1>
<p >Everything within a module should occupy a unique namespace. Functions names, non-static global variables, and other public entities should be named 'mod_&lt;name&gt;_&lt;regular name&gt;'. Macros and constants should be named MOD_&lt;name&gt;_&lt;regular name&gt;. This avoids potential namespace collisions.</p>
<p >All modules should begin with the following line: #include "../../api.h"</p>
<p >Including this file should get you access to the commonplace structures and functions in the MUSH server, as well as specific module API things. Please note that if you plan to use any symbol that's not defined within api.h or a file that is #include'd by api.h, you will either need to declare it extern within your module's .c file, or #include the appropriate main server .h file, as appropriate.</p>
<p >CAUTION: Not all operating system's dlopen() calls properly check for unresolved references. On such a system, if you reference a symbol that your module cannot locate because it's not local and it wasn't declared as extern, the server will crash when it tries to resolve the symbol.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md77"></a>
MODULE CONFIGURATION</h1>
<p >The module configuration should come next, since the rest of your module will use this information.</p>
<p >You should declare a configuration structure for your module as follows:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">struct mod_&lt;name&gt;_confstorage {</div>
<div class="line">    &lt;type1&gt; &lt;name1&gt;;</div>
<div class="line">    &lt;typeN&gt; &lt;nameN&gt;;</div>
<div class="line">} mod_&lt;name&gt;_config;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p >Then, you should declare a configuration table, as follows:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">CONF mod_&lt;name&gt;_conftable[] = {</div>
<div class="line">{(char *)&quot;&lt;name&gt;_alias&quot;,    cf_alias,   &lt;set perms&gt;,    &lt;read perms&gt;,</div>

<div class="line">{ NULL, NULL, 0, 0, NULL, 0}};</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p >Note that the table must always end with a null entry.</p>
<p >In the conf file, any config parameters for a module must, of course, be placed after module directive loading that module.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md78"></a>
MODULE INITIALIZATION</h1>
<p >The module initialization function goes LAST in your module's .c file. It should read as follows:</p>

</table>
<p >api.h defines a number of macros used to declare command handlers. These should be largely self-explanatory. The syntax of a command handler is:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">DO_CMD_&lt;type&gt;(mod_&lt;name&gt;_do_&lt;handler name&gt;)</div>
<div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">    /* code goes here */</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p >To write a handler for "@hello", a command with one argument in a module called "hello", for example, you would write:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">DO_CMD_ONE_ARG(mod_hello_do_hello)</div>
<div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">    /* code goes here */</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p >Once you have declared all of your handlers, you must place the handlers in the command table, which takes the following format:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">CMDENT mod_&lt;name&gt;_cmdtable[] = {</div>
<div class="line">{(char *)&quot;&lt;command1&gt;&quot;,      &lt;switches&gt;, &lt;permissions&gt;,</div>
<div class="line">    0,      CS_&lt;handler type&gt;,</div>
<div class="line">    NULL,       NULL,   NULL,       {&lt;handler function&gt;}},</div>
<div class="line">{(char *)&quot;&lt;command2&gt;&quot;,      &lt;switches&gt;, &lt;permissions&gt;,</div>
<div class="line">    0,      CS_&lt;handler type&gt;,</div>
<div class="line">    NULL,       NULL,   NULL,       {&lt;handler function&gt;}},</div>
<div class="line">{(char *)NULL,          NULL,       0,</div>
<div class="line">    0,      0,</div>
<div class="line">    NULL,       NULL,   NULL,       {NULL}}};</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p >You can put as many commands into this table as you'd like. Make sure it ends with the "null" entry, though.</p>
<p >&lt;switches&gt; is the name of a switch table, described below.</p>
<p >&lt;permissions&gt; consist of an OR'd ('|') list of permissions, such as CA_PUBLIC, CA_WIZARD, and CA_GOD.</p>
<p >&lt;handler type&gt; is the same as the &lt;handler function&gt; type. For example, if you have DO_CMD_NO_ARG(mod_hello_do_heythere), then you will have CS_CMD_NO_ARG for &lt;handler type&gt;. Your &lt;handler function&gt; will be mod_hello_do_heythere.</p>
<p >A switch table takes the following form:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">NAMETAB mod_&lt;name&gt;_&lt;command&gt;_sw[] = {</div>
<div class="line">{(char *)&quot;switch1&quot;, &lt;letters&gt;,  &lt;permissions&gt;,  &lt;key&gt;},</div>
<div class="line">{(char *)&quot;switch2&quot;, &lt;letters&gt;,  &lt;permissions&gt;,  &lt;key&gt;},</div>
<div class="line">{ NULL,         0,      0,      0}};</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p >A command can take an arbitrary number of switches, so each of these switch tables can be as large as you like. Make sure the switch table ends with the "null" entry, though.</p>
<p >&lt;letters&gt; is the number of unique letters of the switch that someone has to type. For example, if your switch name is "foobar", and &lt;letters&gt; is 3, then '/foo' is sufficient.</p>
<p >&lt;permissions&gt; consist of an OR'd ('|') list of permissions, such as CA_PUBLIC, CA_WIZARD, and CA_GOD, just like in the main command table.</p>
<p >&lt;key&gt; is a bit key; handler functions check 'key &amp; &lt;key&gt;' to modify their behavior based on any switches the user passed. If you want a command to be able to take multiple switches as the same time, you should add '|SW_MULTIPLE' to &lt;key&gt;.</p>
<p >Switch tables should be placed BEFORE the command table, in your module's .c file.</p>
<p >If your module defines any single-character prefix commands, you should enter them as CS_ONE_ARG|CS_LEADIN commands in your command table, and also pass the relevant prefix characters in a string to <a class="el" href="api_8c.html#a0f1ec855f01525a7c9f05ca64d2cbcdf" title="Register prefix commands.">register_prefix_cmds()</a>. See the "-" command in the included mail module for example.</p>
<hr  />
<p >DEFINING FUNCTIONS</p>
<p >A function handler takes the following form:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">FUNCTION(mod_&lt;name&gt;_fun_&lt;function name&gt;)</div>
<div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">    /* code goes here */</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p >See functions.h for what this macro'd function prototype expands to. See the server's fun*.c files for some examples of how to write functions.</p>
<p >Once you have declared all of your function handlers, you must place them in the function table, which takes the following format:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">FUN mod_&lt;name&gt;_functable[] = {</div>
<div class="line">{&quot;FUNCTION1&quot;,   &lt;handler&gt;,  &lt;args&gt;, &lt;flags&gt;,    &lt;permissions&gt;},</div>
<div class="line">{&quot;FUNCTION2&quot;,   &lt;handler&gt;,  &lt;args&gt;, &lt;flags&gt;,    &lt;permissions&gt;},</div>
<div class="line">{NULL,      NULL,       0,  0,      0}};</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p >You can put as many functions into this table as you'd like. Make sure it ends with the "null" entry, though.</p>
<p >&lt;handler&gt; is the name of the function handler (the name of the C function that's handling the function call: mod_&lt;name&gt;_&lt;fun&gt;_&lt;whatever&gt;).</p>
<p >&lt;args&gt; is the number of arguments that the function should take. If this is variable, use 0.</p>
<p >&lt;flags&gt; are any special function-handling flags, OR'd ('|') together. Functions taking a variable number of arguments get a FN_VARARGS flag. Functions whose arguments should be passed unevaluated get a FN_NO_EVAL flag.</p>
<p >&lt;permissions&gt; consist of an OR'd ('|') list of permissions, such as CA_PUBLIC, CA_WIZARD, and CA_GOD, just like in the main command table.</p>
<hr  />
<p >DEFINING HASH TABLES</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">HASHTAB mod_&lt;name&gt;_&lt;htabname1&gt;;</div>
<div class="line">HASHTAB mod_&lt;name&gt;_&lt;htabnameN&gt;;</div>

</div><!-- fragment --><p >The initial size factor will be multiplied by the hash factor. The minimum is the absolute smallest size of the hash table, which must be a power of 2.</p>
<hr  />
<p >EXTENDING THE DATABASE</p>
<p >Though modules have access to the db structure, modules cannot add their own data types to that db structure.</p>
<p >Thus, if you need to store a piece of data for every object in the database, your module needs to have its own parallel db structure, as follows:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">typedef struct mod_&lt;name&gt;_dbobj MOD_&lt;name&gt;_OBJ;</div>
<div class="line">struct mod_&lt;name&gt;_dbobj {</div>

<div class="line">    DB_GROW_MODULE(mod_&lt;name&gt;_db, newsize, newtop, MOD_&lt;name&gt;_OBJ);</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p >The above will automatically take care of extending and initializing your private module database as needed. Initialization of newly-created objects should be taken care of by creating a handler for create_obj() (see below).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md83"></a>
MODULE API FUNCTIONS</h1>
<p >The following are "hooks" into the server. If you place these functions in your module's .c file, they will automatically be called at the appropriate time.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">void mod_&lt;name&gt;_create_obj(dbref player, dbref obj)</div>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md87"></a>
STORING DATA IN FLATFILES</h1>
<p >This is the first and easiest of three different methods available to a module for storing module-specific data.</p>
<p >Using this method, the module reads its data from a pure ASCII text flatfile on startup, via a module API hook, as follows:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">void mod_&lt;name&gt;_load_database(FILE *f)</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> This loads the flatfile specific to the module. It is called at start time, immediately after the main MUSH database and any module GDBM data (see below) is loaded. This function is passed a single input parameter, an open, read-only file pointer for the module flatfile.</p>
<p >Every time the server checkpoints ("database dump" time), it dumps a flatfile containing that data, via the following module API hook:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">void mod_&lt;name&gt;_dump_database(FILE *f)</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> This dumps a flat text database specific to the module. It is called at checkpoint time. This function is passed a single input parameter, an open, write-only file pointer for the module flatfile.</p>
<p >The module flatfile is named 'mod_&lt;name&gt;.db' and is stored in the directory specified by the conf parameter database_home. This database file should NEVER be opened or closed directly.</p>
<p >Only printable ASCII data should be stored in this file. You, the module author, are responsible for versioning, the format of this file, etc. Useful functions for reading and writing flatfiles can be found in the core server's <a class="el" href="db__rw_8c.html" title="flatfile implementation">db_rw.c</a> source.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md88"></a>
STORING DATA IN GDBM WITH NO CACHING</h1>
<p >This is the second of three different methods available to a module for storing module-specific data.</p>
<p >This method directly stores data within the MUSH's general GDBM database. GDBM is a 'random-access' database that allows you to store and fetch individual pieces of data at a time. This is identical to how the MUSH stores its structure data and requires your module to be able to dump or convert a printable ASCII flatfile when database conversion (backups to and restores from flatfile) is run.</p>
<p >Since the MUSH stores many different types of data in GDBM, it has to have a way to keep these pieces of data seperate. It does so by allocating each subsystem a 'dbtype' number. A block of numbers is already reserved for internal MUSH data, and the rest are available for use by modules. Each subsystem specifies this number when it stores data. Before you may read or write to GDBM, your module must obtain a dbtype number with the register_dbtype function:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">unsigned int register_dbtype(char *modname) </div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> Assigns a new dbtype ID number for a certain module name. If a dbtype ID has already been assigned for that module, it will be returned.</p>
<p >There are four API hooks provided for reading data needed at startup and checkpointing to GDBM as well as reading and writing flatfiles:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">void mod_&lt;name&gt;_db_read(void)</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> Load any module-specific data from GDBM at startup. Called during MUSH startup, and during the backup conversion process before <a class="el" href="db__rw_8c.html#a6d1bddbab6656f3506368a11feee62a4" title="Write a db to Flat File.">db_write_flatfile()</a> is called. Use this to load data which must be present when the MUSH starts.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">void mod_&lt;name&gt;_db_write(void)</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> Write any module-specific data to GDBM. Called during MUSH checkpoints, at shutdown, and during the restoral conversion process after <a class="el" href="db__rw_8c.html#a850d602c8ad86e2de86992986370a667" title="Read a flatfile.">db_read_flatfile()</a> is called.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">void mod_&lt;name&gt;_db_read_flatfile(FILE *f) </div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> Load and convert flat text database specific to module, called during the restoral db conversion process (the 'Restore' script). This is identical to the 'load_database' hook except it is ONLY called during database conversion.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">void mod_&lt;name&gt;_db_write_flatfile(FILE *f) </div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> Dump flat text database specific to module, called during the backup db conversion process (the 'Backup' script). This is identical to the 'dump_database' hook except it is ONLY called during database conversion and flatfile generation (IE, @dump/flatfile).</p>
<p >It is important to note that <a class="el" href="api_8c.html#ac88119314cc5dc4a2de408653b586f64" title="Register a module&#39;s DB type.">register_dbtype()</a> must be called at the beginning of each of these four functions since module initialization DOES NOT TAKE PLACE when your module is loaded during database conversion, and your module cannot know which of these functions will be called first. If your module does not use db_read or db_write, you should call register_dbtype during your cleanup_startup hook to make sure it gets called before anything else. You cannot call register_dbtype in your init hook because init is called before the database is opened.</p>
<p >A typical MUSH server run will look like this: </p><pre class="fragment">* MUSH startup
* Module initialization:            mod_\&lt;name&gt;_init()
* Module executes db_read:          mod_\&lt;name&gt;_db_read()
                                    register_dbtype()

* MUSH shutdown:                    mod_\&lt;name&gt;_db_write()
</pre><p> A backup database process will look like this: </p><pre class="fragment">* Database conversion begins

                                register_dbtype()
* Module reads data from GDBM
* Module writes flatfile:       mod_\&lt;name&gt;_db_write_flatfile()
* Database conversion ends
</pre><p> A restoral process will look like this: </p><pre class="fragment">* Database conversion begins

                                register_dbtype()
* Module writes data to GDBM
* Database conversion ends
</pre><p> Reading and writing to GDBM only during <a class="el" href="db__rw_8c.html#afa51b4a7bd45cad467913b376bdae48b" title="Read a DB.">db_read()</a> and <a class="el" href="db__rw_8c.html#ae3b2fe2b1852143ff0ee2a0140f9c05a" title="Write DB to file.">db_write()</a> doesn't offer much advantage over just using flatfiles. However, the advantage of GDBM is that you may read or write any piece of data at any time instead of having to do it all at once. So while the MUSH is running, if your module's data is modified you may choose to write just that data immediately or wait until <a class="el" href="db__rw_8c.html#ae3b2fe2b1852143ff0ee2a0140f9c05a" title="Write DB to file.">db_write()</a> to write it. In any case, you must make sure that all of your module's data is stored when <a class="el" href="db__rw_8c.html#ae3b2fe2b1852143ff0ee2a0140f9c05a" title="Write DB to file.">db_write()</a> is finished to ensure consistency when the MUSH is shut down.</p>
<p >Note that during the database conversion process you may have your module read a piece of data from GDBM and write it immediately to a flatfile, or vice versa.</p>
<p >So far we've told you when you can read and write, but not how. Another advantage of GDBM is that you are not limited to printable ASCII data, but that you can store binary data of arbitrary length.</p>
<p >DBData is a structure used by the database API which contains two items: dptr (a pointer to a piece of data) and dsize (the length of that data). DBData is used by the API interface both for search keys and returned or stored data. DBData is declared thusly:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">typedef struct {</div>
<div class="line">    void *dptr;</div>
<div class="line">    int dsize;</div>
<div class="line">} DBData;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p >There are three functions available for reading, writing, and deleting data in the database:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">DBData db_get(DBData key, unsigned int dbtype)</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> <pre class="fragment">Retrieves data from GDBM. 

'key' is a DBData structure that contains a search key of
binary data as well as the length of that data.

'dbtype' should be the dbtype ID registered for your module by
register_dbtype().

db_get returns a DBData structure which contains the returned data
(or NULL if the key cannot be found in the database) as well as the
length of that data. It is *your* responsibility to free() the data
returned by db_get.
</pre> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">int db_put(DBData key, DBData data, unsigned int dbtype)</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> <pre class="fragment">Stores or replaces data in GDBM.

'key' is a DBData structure that contains a search key of

'data' is a DBData structure which contains the binary data to be

register_dbtype().

db_put returns 0 on success and 1 on failure.
</pre> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">int db_del(DBData key, unsigned int dbtype)</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> Deletes data from GDBM.</p>
<p >'key' is a DBData structure that contains a search key of binary data as well as the length of that data.</p>

<p >db_del returns 0 on success and 1 on failure.</p>
<p >Your search key may be a string, a number, or binary data of any length. For example, if you want your search key to be three integers, you will create a buffer of length 'sizeof(int)*3' and copy your three integers into it. If you want it to be a null-terminated string, make sure your key length is 'strlen(string) + 1'.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md89"></a>
STORING DATA IN GDBM WITH CACHING</h1>
<p >This is the third of three different methods available to a module for storing module-specific data. It is fundamentally similar to the second method, except data is cached in memory.</p>
<p >In MUSH, the cache is essentially a front-end to GDBM, and interacting with it is identical. In fact, the function calls match almost exactly. Instead of db_get(), db_put(), and db_del(), you use cache_get(), cache_put(), and cache_del(). The parameters to the cache functions are the same ones you pass to their GDBM counterparts. The cache acts as a 'buffer', making sure the most often accessed data is already in memory, and making writes more efficient by buffering them until a number of entries may be written at once. You don't need to worry about how the cache operates; it will make sure everything gets read and written properly.</p>
<p >Note that you cannot pass a non-malloc()ed piece of memory to cache_put. It must have been malloc()ed, and it will become the cache subsystem's responsibility to free it.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md90"></a>
WHICH METHOD OF STORING DATA TO USE</h1>
<p >If the amount of data your module works with is small and fits easily into memory, use simple flatfiles with load_database() and dump_database() hooks. You do not need to worry about database conversion since all of your data is always in a flatfile!</p>
<p >If you need random access to your data, consider using GDBM. The main server uses GDBM to store everything, from object structures to attribute names. Since it can write individual entries, it only has to write entries that have changed instead of writing them all, thus making the process more efficient. It also allows you to easily store binary data.</p>
<p >If your module with large pieces of data that are needed infrequently, considering using the cache. MUSH attributes are stored using the cache, and data like mail messages or large pieces of text are perfect candidates for it.</p>
<p >As an example, the main server does not cache object structures or attribute names. It reads these completely in at startup in its own <a class="el" href="db__rw_8c.html#afa51b4a7bd45cad467913b376bdae48b" title="Read a DB.">db_read()</a>, and writes all changes out during every <a class="el" href="db__rw_8c.html#ae3b2fe2b1852143ff0ee2a0140f9c05a" title="Write DB to file.">db_write()</a>. It does, however, cache attribute text, and may read or write attributes using the cache at any time while the MUSH process is running. A similar process takes place during database conversion. When it is creating a flatfile from GDBM, MUSH will first load all object structures and attribute names into memory during <a class="el" href="db__rw_8c.html#afa51b4a7bd45cad467913b376bdae48b" title="Read a DB.">db_read()</a>. When <a class="el" href="db__rw_8c.html#a6d1bddbab6656f3506368a11feee62a4" title="Write a db to Flat File.">db_write_flatfile()</a> executes, it will write a printable ASCII text representation of object structures and attribute names to the flatfile, and it will fetch attributes from GDBM and write them to the flatfile one at a time. At no time does it have all attributes in memory, and it does not even use the cache during database conversion, instead using the direct to GDBM routines.</p>
<p >IMPORTANT NOTE: If you use GDBM, it is your responsibility to clean up your entries if they are no longer used. Since GDBM is not a relational database (you cannot do a wildcard search, you <em>must</em> search for an exact key), you must keep track of every entry that you write to it. Look at the code in <a class="el" href="db__rw_8c.html" title="flatfile implementation">db_rw.c</a> that writes attribute names for an example of how to do this. If your module writes entries to GDBM and never deletes them, they will clog the database until it is converted to flatfile and back, dropping the unused entries in the process.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md91"></a>
GETTING NOTIFIED WHEN DATA CHANGES</h1>
<p >You can have your module notified when a key is stored or deleted in the cache using the following API hooks:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">int cache_put_notify(DBData key, unsigned int dbtype)</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> This hook is called when a piece of data is added to or changed in the MUSH cache. Your module should check for an applicable data type before using the key.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">int cache_put_notify(DBData key, unsigned int dbtype)</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> This hook is called when a piece of data is deleted from the MUSH cache. Your module should check for an applicable data type before using the key. </p>
