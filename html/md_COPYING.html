<div class="line">                                Preamble</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a</div>
<div class="line">Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some</div>
<div class="line">semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,</div>
<div class="line">while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute</div>
<div class="line">the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make</div>
<div class="line">reasonable modifications.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Definitions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">        &quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the</div>
<div class="line">        Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files</div>
<div class="line">        created through textual modification.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">        &quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been</div>
<div class="line">        modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes</div>
<div class="line">        of the Copyright Holder as specified below.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">        &quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or</div>
<div class="line">        copyrights for the package.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">        &quot;You&quot; is you, if you&#39;re thinking about copying or distributing</div>
<div class="line">        this Package.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">        &quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the</div>
<div class="line">        basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,</div>
<div class="line">        and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the</div>
<div class="line">        Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large</div>
<div class="line">        as a market that must bear the fee.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">        &quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item</div>
<div class="line">        itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.</div>
<div class="line">        It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it</div>
<div class="line">        under the same conditions they received it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the</div>
<div class="line">Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you</div>
<div class="line">duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications</div>
<div class="line">derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package</div>
<div class="line">modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided</div>
<div class="line">that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and</div>
<div class="line">when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the</div>
<div class="line">following:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them</div>
<div class="line">    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or</div>
<div class="line">    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive</div>
<div class="line">    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include</div>
<div class="line">    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict</div>
<div class="line">    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide</div>
<div class="line">    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly</div>
<div class="line">    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or</div>
<div class="line">executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,</div>
<div class="line">    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where</div>
<div class="line">    to get the Standard Version.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of</div>
<div class="line">    the Package with your modifications.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly</div>
<div class="line">    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together</div>
<div class="line">    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this</div>
<div class="line">Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this</div>
<div class="line">Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,</div>
<div class="line">you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly</div>
<div class="line">commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software</div>
<div class="line">distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a</div>
<div class="line">product of your own.  You may embed this Package&#39;s interpreter within</div>
<div class="line">an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere</div>
<div class="line">form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the</div>
<div class="line">interpreter is so embedded.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as</div>
<div class="line">output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall</div>
<div class="line">under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated</div>
<div class="line">them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this</div>
<div class="line">Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this</div>
<div class="line">Package via the so-called &quot;undump&quot; or &quot;unexec&quot; methods of producing a</div>
<div class="line">binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall</div>
<div class="line">neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it</div>
<div class="line">fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do</div>
<div class="line">not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this</div>
<div class="line">Package.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other</div>
<div class="line">languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to</div>
<div class="line">emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this</div>
<div class="line">Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the</div>
<div class="line">equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do</div>
<div class="line">not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the</div>
<div class="line">regression tests for the language.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always</div>
<div class="line">permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,</div>
<div class="line">when no overt attempt is made to make this Package&#39;s interfaces visible</div>
<div class="line">to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be</div>
<div class="line">construed as a distribution of this Package.</div>
