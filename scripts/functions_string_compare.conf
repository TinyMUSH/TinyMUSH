# TinyMUSH Regression Tests - String Comparison & Matching Functions
# Covers: alphamax(), alphamin(), comp(), diffpos(), isalnum(), isdbref(), isnum(), isword(), regmatch(), regmatchi(), streq(), strmatch(), wildmatch()

# Alphabetical extrema
think eq(alphamax(foo,bar,baz),foo) | 1
think eq(alphamin(foo,bar,baz),bar) | 1

# Exact string comparison (lexicographic)
think comp(abc,abd) | -1
think comp(abd,abc) | 1
think comp(abc,abc) | 0

# First differing position (0-based), -1 if identical
think diffpos(abc,abX) | 2
think diffpos(abc,abc) | -1

# Character class checks
think isword(abc) | 1
think isword(abc123) | 0
think isalnum(abc123) | 1
think isalnum(abc_123) | 0
think isnum(123) | 1
think isnum(12a) | 0

# DBRef validation (must exist)
think isdbref(#1) | 1
think isdbref(#999999) | 0

# Case-insensitive equality
think streq(Cat,cat) | 1
think streq(Cat,Dog) | 0

# Wildcard matching (entire string)
think strmatch(foobar,foo*) | 1
think strmatch(foobar,?oob*) | 1
think strmatch(foobar,f*baz) | 0

# Regex matching
think regmatch(AbC,^a.*c$) | 0
think regmatchi(AbC,^a.*c$) | 1

# Wildcard matching with registers (boolean only here; use -1 to discard captures)
think wildmatch(hello,he*o,-1) | 1
think wildmatch(hello,h?llo,-1) | 1
think wildmatch(hello,ha*o,-1) | 0
