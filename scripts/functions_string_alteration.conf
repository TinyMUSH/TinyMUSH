# TinyMUSH Regression Tests - String Alteration Functions
# Functions: chomp(), delete(), edit(), merge(), regedit(), regediti(), regeditall(), regeditalli(), reverse(), scramble()
# Format: command | expected substring

# chomp() trims trailing %r
think chomp(Hello%r) | Hello

# delete() removes <len> chars starting at zero-based <first>
think delete(abcdefgh,3,2) | abcfgh
think delete(Would you like coffee or perhaps tea?,15,18) | Would you like tea?

# edit() find/replace and prepend/append helpers
think edit(This is a test,is,x) | Thx x a test
think edit(Atlantic,^,Trans) | TransAtlantic
think edit(FOO-BAR-BAZ,BAR,baz) | FOO-baz-BAZ

# merge() replaces placeholders in string1 with chars from string2
think merge(AB--EF,abcdef,-) | ABcdEF

# regedit family: first/all, case-sensitive/insensitive
think regedit(The number is 12345,^T..,A) | A number is 12345
think regediti(fooBARbaz,bar,XXX) | fooXXXbaz
think regeditall(ha ha ha,ha,HE) | HE HE HE
think regeditalli(Fizz BUZZ fizz,FIZZ,FIZ) | FIZ BUZZ FIZ

# reverse() reverses characters
think reverse(abcde) | edcba

# reverse() reverses characters (test for leaking escape sequences)
think [reverse(abcde)] foo | edcba foo

# scramble() random permutation; verify length unchanged via strlen
think strlen(scramble(abcdef)) | 6

# scramble() random permutation (test for leaking escape sequences)
think [scramble(aaa)] foo | aaa foo
