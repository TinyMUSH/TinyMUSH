TinyMUSH 3 Copyright: The Artistic License

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to
make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:
    - "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
      Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
      created through textual modification.
    - "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
      modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of
      the Copyright Holder.
    - "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
      copyrights for the package.
    - "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
      this Package.
    - "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis
      of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and
      so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
      Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market
      that must bear the fee.)
    - "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
      itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It
      also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under
      the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of
the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided
that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and
associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do
at least ONE of the following:

  a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make
  them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to
  Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a
  major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright
  Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the
  Package.

  b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or
  organization.

  c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
  with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
  a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that
  clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

  d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

  a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library
  files, together with instructions (in the manual page or
  equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.

  b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
  the Package with your modifications.

  c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding
  Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables
  non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in
  manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where
  to get the Standard Version.

  d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of
this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial)
software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package
as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package.

7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package
shall not be considered part of this Package.

8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
promote products derived from this software without specific prior
written permission.

9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

TinyMUSH 2.2 Credits:

TinyMUSH 2.2 is the result of the efforts of many, many people. A few
deserve special mention here: Andrew Molitor, Russ Smith, Mark Vasoll,
and Dave McCracken for much in the way of code and advice; Alan Schwartz
and T. Alexander "Talek" Popiel (PennMUSH) and David Passmore (TinyMUX)
for ideas and code; and John Batzel (and the rest of the PernMUSH
wizcrew) for beta-testing, many ideas, and a lot of patience.

TinyMUSH 3 Credits:

Many people contributed to the end result which is TinyMUSH 3. They
include:

	- Fred "Iago" Hicks, for the logo
	- Deborah Wilson-Hooker, T. Alexander Popiel, JT Traub, and
	  Andrew Molitor, as always
	- The players of From the Ashes, Babylon 5: The Last Best Hope,
	  and Blood of Amber, for alpha testing
	- The TinyMUX and Hogs lists, and the players of the Godlike Edge,
	  for everything

... and everyone who participated in the religious wars between TinyMUSH
    and TinyMUX, which ultimately spurred our decision to merge them. :)
