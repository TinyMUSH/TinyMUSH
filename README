TinyMUSH 3 began as a project to fuse the TinyMUSH 2.2 and TinyMUX
codebases, in an effort to create a best-of-breed server that combined
the best features and enhancements of both, and then built additional
innovations and increased stability on top of that merged codebase.

TinyMUSH 3.0 is not a rewrite; we wanted to maintain close to 100%
backwards compatibility, and the sheer scope of effort that would have
been necessary in order to create a new server from scratch was beyond
our available time resources. However, every line of the code has been
gone through in the process of creating TinyMUSH 3.0. A large number
of bugs have been fixed, portions have been rewritten to be cleaner
and more efficient, and a slew of new features have been added.
TinyMUSH 3.1 and beyond will extend this further, providing a solidly
stable server, improved efficiency, and many feature enhancements.

The initial TinyMUSH 3.0 release was jointly developed by David
Passmore and Lydia Leong; Robby Griffin joined the team with the
release of 3.0 beta 18, and Scott Dorr joined with the release of
3.0 beta 23, and the team expects to continue to maintain TinyMUSH 3
into the forseeable future. Though we will continue to welcome
contributions from the MUSH community, we expect to remain the primary
developers. We believe that this will be a major platform of choice
for MUSH users in the future, and we highly encourage existing
TinyMUSH 2.2 and TinyMUX 1.x users to upgrade.

We believe that server stability for TinyMUSH 3.0 to be excellent
(no reported crash problems since the 3.0p2 release in January 2001),
and we expect that TinyMUSH 3.1 stability to be at least as good.
Server stability for beta versions should generally be good, but,
of course, may not be as stable as full-fledged release versions.
In general, TinyMUSH 3 should be more stable than any of its
predecessor servers. Problems or issues should certainly be reported
to the developers, and we will do our best to ensure that they're
fixed promptly.
