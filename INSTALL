INSTALLATION

TinyMUSH 3 should be straightforward to install and run.

The installation process assumes that you are familiar with basic Unix
commands. If you are not familiar with basic Unix commands, you will
probably need the help of someone with at least some Unix familiarity,
in order to be able to reliably run your game. Also, your local
bookstore can probably recommend some good books for Unix beginners,
such as "Unix for Dummies" or "Unix for the Impatient".

*Please* read the FAQ file. It contains important information about
how to configure the server, make backups of your database, report
bugs, and the like.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TABLE OF CONTENTS

- One-step installation
- Simple custom installation
- Step-by-step installation
- Starting a new game
- Upgrading from TinyMUSH 3.0
- Converting from another MU* type
- Compatibility
- System Requirements

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ONE-STEP INSTALLATION

If you want to build the server using the standard default configuration,
just type:

./Build

(You must be in the directory that this INSTALL file is in.)

When the build finishes, assuming there are no errors, you are ready to
start a new MUSH, or convert an existing MUSH to TinyMUSH 3.

If the build fails for some reason, look in the section of this
install guide titled COMPATIBILITY for help.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SIMPLE CUSTOM INSTALLATION

For your convenience, the Build script accepts options to be passed to
the configure script. For more information, type:

./Build --help

(You must be in the directory that this INSTALL file is in.)

This will show you a long list of optional features you can enable or
disable using configure options, including modules, and lists the
default settings. Make a note of the options you would like to use,
and then run the Build script with those options. For example, to
build the mush without Pueblo client support, you'd type:

./Build --disable-pueblo

(You must be in the directory that this INSTALL file is in.)

When the build finishes, assuming there are no errors, you are ready to
start a new MUSH, or convert an existing MUSH to TinyMUSH 3.

If the build fails for some reason, look in the section of this
install guide titled COMPATIBILITY for help.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP-BY-STEP INSTALLATION

If you decide not to use the one-step install, or you encounter problems
in the one-step install, the installation process is as follows:

- Go to the top-level directory (the directory where this INSTALL file
  is normally located).

- Go into the directory for GNU dbm; 'cd src/gdbm-1.8.0' should take
  you there.

- Type './configure --enable-shared=no --enable-static=yes', then type
  'make' . This will compile the GNU dbm library, which is required by
  TinyMUSH 3.

  Please Note: TinyMUSH 3 requires gdbm-1.8.0! If gdbm is already
  installed on your system, chances are that it's version 1.7.3 or
  earlier -- do NOT ignore this step.

- Go back to the src directory ('cd ..').

- View options for the configure script, by typing './configure --help'.
  This will show you a long list of optional features you can enable or
  disable using configure options, including modules, and lists the
  default settings. Make a note of the options you would like to use.

- Run the configure script, by typing './configure' followed by the
  options you've selected. This will customize autoconf.h and the
  Makefile for your system. If you have gcc (the GNU C compiler)
  installed on your system, it will automatically be selected as the
  compiler of choice.

- Edit the Makefile and make any changes that might be necessary (go down
  to the line that says 'CONFIGURATION SECTION'). Note that most of the
  options that used to be set in this section are now set with ./configure
  options. See the notes on Compatibility, later in this file, for some
  operating-system-specific notes and modifications that might need to be
  made that are not handled by the configure script.

- Edit config.h and select the configuration options you want. The options
  are documented in that file.

- CAUTION: You CANNOT use your system GDBM libraries. TinyMUSH's included
  GDBM library contains modifications specific to TinyMUSH, as well as
  bugfixes. The auto-configuration will build and link tinygdbm; do not
  change this!

- To build the program (updating the dependencies if needed, producing a
  number of binaries, as well as modules, and linking them into the
  appropriate place in the directory structure),

  If you are a bash, ksh, pdksh, bsh, or sh shell user, type:

	make 2>&1 | tee Compile.log

  If you are a csh or tcsh shell user, type:

	make |& tee Compile.log

  If you can't get either of the above to work, type:

	make | tee Compile.log

  To find out what shell you're using, type 'basename $SHELL'.

  The record of the compilation will be saved in a file called Compile.log
  (If the build fails for some reason, look in the section of this install
  guide titled COMPATIBILITY for help.)

- You are now ready to start a new game, or convert an existing game to
  TinyMUSH 3.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

STARTING A NEW GAME

- Go into the game directory ('cd game' or 'cd ../game' should do it).

- Edit mush.config, according to the directions in that file.

- If you changed GAMENAME in mush.config, you will need to rename
  netmush.conf to the appropriate thing (i.e., if GAMENAME is foo,
  then you should 'mv netmush.conf foo.conf').

- Edit that conf file (netmush.conf, or whatever you renamed it to).
  Put in whatever configuration parameters are appropriate.

- Start the game by typing './Startmush'.

- Connect to the game using telnet or a MUD client. Log in the "God"
  character with 'connect #1 potrzebie'.

- Change the password of the God character; make sure you make it something
  that you can remember, but which can't be guessed by someone else!
  Type '@password potrzebie = YourNewPassword', where YourNewPassword
  is the new password that you've chosen.

- You are now ready to build your game. It is strongly recommended that
  the God character only be logged in when absolutely necessary; create
  another character for yourself and give it the Wizard flag, for day
  to day use.

- You may want to make sure that you can back up and restore your database:
  Type '@shutdown'. Then, from the game directory, type './Backup'. If the
  backup finishes successfully, type './Restore FILENAME' (where FILENAME
  is the name of the backup file). If this finishes successfully, then
  type './Startmush' to start the game again.

  If you encounter problems at this stage, you have an installation
  problem. The most common is a problem with GNU dbm; this is likely
  the cause if you @shutdown, type './Startmush', and find that the
  attributes in your database are gone. If this happens to you, check
  your configuration and rebuild the netmush binary, if necessary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPGRADING FROM TINYMUSH 3.0

For the sake of these examples, we will assume that your TinyMUSH 3.0
installation is in ~/3.0/ and your TinyMUSH 3.1 installation is in
~/3.1/ -- change these pathnames to whatever they actually are.

Do NOT overwrite your 3.0 installation with 3.1! Once you have upgraded
and tested to make sure your game is running properly, you can delete
your 3.0 installation if you want to.

- Go into the game directory from your TinyMUSH 3.0 install:  cd ~/3.0/game

- Make an archive (using the old 3.0 binaries!) via ./Archive
  It will be called <your game name>-archive.<date>.tar.gz
  The examples below call it netmush-archive.0213-1548.tar.gz -- substitute
  the filename of your own archive. (You may want to make sure you save
  an extra copy of this file somewhere, since it's the archive of all
  of your files from the 3.0 installation.)

- Go into the 3.1 game directory:  cd ~/3.1/game

- Preserve the current mush.config file:  mv mush.config mush.config.default

- Inflate the archive file:
  gzip -dc ~/3.0/game/netmush-archive.0213-1548.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

  This will write the files into your current, 3.1 directory. If you are
  given the option to overwrite files, do so; you want to replace the
  existing defaults.

- Edit the mush.config.default file. Replace the GAMENAME and OWNER
  values with your own game name and email address of the owner. (Look
  at the mush.config file you got from inflating an archive, if you
  need a reminder of what they were.)
 
- Overwrite your old mush.config file with the new one:
  mv -f mush.config.default mush.config

- Edit your game's conf file. It should be called GAMENAME.conf, where
  GAMENAME is whatever you set GAMENAME to in mush.config  -- it's named
  whatever you called it in your 3.0 installation and should have been
  placed in your 3.1 game directory when you expanded the archive.

  - If you have the following parameters set, simply remove them:
    cache_depth
    cache_width
    input_database
    output_database
    mail_database
    comsys_database
    have_comsys
    have_mailer
    format_exits
    format_contents

  - If you were using the built-in comsys, add this line:
    module comsys

  - If you were using the built-in mailer, add this line:
    module mail

  - If you had your database files in the data directory, add this line:
    database_home data
    (If you have your database files in another directory, substitute that
    in instead. Pathnames are relative to the ~/3.1/game directory.)

  - If you have the gdbm_database parameter in your conf file, edit it
    to take away any prepending path. For instance, if your conf file reads:
    gdbm_database data/netmush.gdbm
    change it to read:
    gdbm_database netmush.gdbm

  - If you have the crash_database parameter in your conf file, edit it
    to take away any prepending path. For instance, if your conf file reads:
    crash_database data/netmush.db.CRASH
    change it to read:
    crash_database netmush.db.CRASH

- Convert your database to the new 3.1 format via the following:
  ./Restore netmush.flat.02313-1548
  (Substitute the name of whatever flatfile was in your archive.)

- Rename your comsys and mail databases to the new 3.1 names:
  mv comsys.db mod_comsys.db
  mv mail.db mod_mail.db

  You may need to go into your data directory ('cd data') in order to do
  this; if you do, you should then return to the 3.1 game directory
  ('cd ..') once you've moved the files.

- Start the game by typing './Startmush'.

- Connect to your game, and verify that it's running correctly.

- You may want to make sure that you can back up and restore your database:
  Type '@shutdown'. Then, from the game directory, type './Backup'. If the
  backup finishes successfully, type './Restore FILENAME' (where FILENAME
  is the name of the backup file; it will have a .tar.gz extension). If
  this finishes successfully, then type './Startmush' to start the game
  again.

  If you encounter problems at this stage, you have an installation
  problem. The most common is a problem with GNU dbm; this is likely
  the cause if you @shutdown, type './Startmush', and find that the
  attributes in your database are gone. If this happens to you, check
  your configuration and rebuild the netmush binary, if necessary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONVERTING FROM ANOTHER MU* TYPE

If you are upgrading from TinyMUSH 2.2, read the file 'CONVERT.TINY22'
for instructions.

If you are upgrading from TinyMUX 1.x, read the file 'CONVERT.MUX' for 
instructions.

There is, at present, no automated conversion from TinyMUX 2 or PennMUSH.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPATIBILITY

TinyMUSH 3 is believed to be compatible with all major versions of
Unix, including SunOS 4.1.x, Solaris, Irix, AIX, HP-UX, NetBSD, Linux,
and MacOS X. There is no official native Windows NT/2000 port, at present,
but it will work with the Cygwin or UWIN libraries.

TinyMUSH 3.1 utilizes dynamically loadable modules on many platforms,
thanks to the GNU libtool project, and will be statically linked with
its modules on platforms that do not support dynamic loading.

The frequent releases of new Linux versions, the proliferation of
multiple Linux development paths, and the incompatibility between
multiple versions of the C header files and GNU C library incorporated
into most current versions of Linux, make it very difficult to
maintain "out of the box" 100% compatibility with every version of
Linux. If you are on a Linux system, it is possible that you will
need to make minor tweaks to the Makefile and/or autoconf.h,
particularly if you are running a Linux release more recent than
the release date of this server version.

The Build script (or the directions given above for step-by-step
installation) produces a file in the src directory called Compile.log;
if the compile fails, the developers would like to know what it failed
on so it can be fixed in future releases (and so they can assist you
in getting the server to work on your system), so please mail
tinymush-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net with that file included or attached,
as well as the output of the command 'uname -a' and any other relevant
details about your machine's specific configuration. If you figured
out what you needed to change in order to make the build successful,
please include those instructions in your email, as well.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

The hardware requirements are minimal, by the standards of modern Unix
servers.  You will need a machine with at least 16 MB of physical RAM,
and at least 10 MB of available disk space for the game.

The RAM requirements (actual RAM used) typically vary between 2 and 15
MB; unless your game is huge (more than 50,000 objects), cache tuning
should ensure that you do not consume more RAM.

The network bandwidth needs are minimal; even with a very large MUSH,
it is unlikely that you will pass more than 25 kbps. The average MUSH
user transfers fewer bytes in an entire session, than does someone
viewing a single typical web page.

However, if you plan to run your game over an analog dialup connection
(typically 14.4 kbps - 56 kbps), be aware that latency will affect the
number of commands that have queued up interactively over a given
timeslice, and that you should increase the queue_active_chunk config
parameter.

It is important that you allocate enough disk space; should you ever
run out of it, you will end up with serious database corruption. If
your disks are close to capacity, make sure that you do frequent
backups.

There are no significant security concerns involved in running a MUSH
on a server, save for possibly increasing its "visibility" on the Internet
and therefore making it the target of more attempts to breach the
system's security. The MUSH server can run comfortably in a chroot'd
environment, and does not provide any players with access to the
filesystem or underlying system.

Nonetheless, you should also obtain the consent of your systems
administrator before running a MUSH on a system. Virtually all
Internet service providers ban the running of MUDs on their shell
machines. Therefore, you will probably need either a MUD hosting
service or a personal server, if you plan to run a public game.
